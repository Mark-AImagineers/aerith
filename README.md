# AERITH

*Aerith is my personal command console â€” a hacker-inspired, full-screen terminal interface designed to run and orchestrate all my personal microtools, services, and dev workflows.*

Itâ€™s not just a launcher. Itâ€™s a digital command center â€” built for flow, style, and control.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Vision

Aerith is the OS-like terminal I wish existed.

- ðŸŸ¢ Retro hacker-glow UI (powered by [Textual](https://github.com/Textualize/textual))
- ðŸ’» CLI-driven command routing (via [Typer](https://github.com/tiangolo/typer))
- ðŸ§© Modular tool system (local scripts or remote service hooks)
- ðŸ§  Reads from `version.json` for all build metadata â€” never hardcoded
- ðŸ¤– Grows with me as I build more microservices, automations, and workflows

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

    - A green-themed full-screen UI
    - A greeting prompt
